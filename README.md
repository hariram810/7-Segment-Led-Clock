Ardhuino Controlled 7 Segment Clock Made With Leds


The clock is made using arduino and other components as mentioned the files and all pictures are attached below

the control of the clock is done by arduino or you can use 74HC595 Drivers for easy control

In this case, I used it to simulate an analog clock without its hands, with very interesting results. The hours and minutes are placed around the center of matrix giving a familiar look of analog clocks. The code I have developed applies a little of trigonometry (sine and cosine) to calculate the coordinates of hours and minutes to be shown into LED matrix. With that I saved many lines of coding.

Every time you reset or restart the Arduino, the time mode will change.

The first four digits at left of display show the hours and minutes in decimal numbers. The next three digits show the hours, minutes and seconds in binary notation and the last digit at right inform the weekday.

About the code, I had to develop a way to use the "LedControl" library to turn conventional 7-Seg decimal display into a Binary display. The solution is to use "setRow" function that is usually applied for dot matrix display.

Step 1: Assembly

24-hour clock display need six seven segment displays. But for building digital clock we have to use only a single microcontroller. The problem we face is the lack of input pins on the microcontroller. In Arduino UNO it contain ATMEGA328p microcontroller which has 23 input pins only. Whereas for making clock we require six displays. As one display would take 8 pins and so three SSD would take 24 pins. For making the connections we have to use multiplexing all the seven segment displays.
